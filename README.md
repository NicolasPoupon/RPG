team know.  
Your game must follow the following rules:  
 - The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.  
 - The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.  
 - There must be NPC in your game.  
 - You need to implement at least one quest.  
 - The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.  
 - The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.  
 - With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.    

To give the users the feeling that youâ€™re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible
your game.    

 - Having a pleasant user interface.  
 - Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)  
 - Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.  
 - Create a game with a beginning and an end
